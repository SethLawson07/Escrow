# What is an Escrow contract in solidity ?

>In Solidity, an escrow contract is a contract that acts as a trusted third party to guarantee the performance of a transaction between two parties. In an escrow contract, funds are deposited with the contract, and the contract can then decide to distribute them to the parties involved based on certain predefined conditions.

>An example of the use of an escrow contract might be a payment system for an online transaction between a buyer and a seller. The buyer could deposit the funds with the escrow contract, and the contract would only distribute the funds to the seller once the buyer has confirmed receipt of the goods.

>Indeed, the use of an escrow contract can be seen as contradicting some of the fundamental principles of blockchain. The blockchain is generally considered to be a decentralized, transparent and self-executing system that allows transactions to be made without the need for a trusted third party.

>An escrow contract, on the other hand, often involves the use of a trusted third party to ensure that funds are held securely until the terms of the contract are met. This may seem to contradict the purpose of decentralization of the blockchain.

>However, in some cases, the use of an escrow contract may be considered a necessary measure to ensure the security of funds in complex transactions. It is important to weigh the pros and cons of using an escrow contract based on the specific needs of each case.
