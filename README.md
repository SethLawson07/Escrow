# C'est quoi un contrat Escrow en solidity ?

>In Solidity, an escrow contract is a contract that acts as a trusted third party to guarantee the performance of a transaction between two parties. In an escrow contract, funds are deposited with the contract, and the contract can then decide to distribute them to the parties involved based on certain predefined conditions.

>An example of the use of an escrow contract might be a payment system for an online transaction between a buyer and a seller. The buyer could deposit the funds with the escrow contract, and the contract would only distribute the funds to the seller once the buyer has confirmed receipt of the goods.
